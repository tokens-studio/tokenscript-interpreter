# Transform Pipeline

Something thats really cool about tokenscript as a tool builder is having interpreted symbols ready to transform from any shape of your input data.

If you have any specific input shape because that's your most prominent platform (most likely web) for any token type, it's so easy to transform to some other platform specific output!

## Example

Your input is a web platform border string value like `1px solid #F00`.

Without any extra schemas this gets parsed as `List [NumberWithUnit(1px),  String("solid"), Color.Hex("#F00")]`

This I can really easily match and transform to any type of output I would like.

Say in penpot I need a object with these properties spread out, I can easily just use a Javascript function

```javascript
// Using something like ts-match to easily match the expected shape of input data
const cssBorderToObject = (input: TokenScriptSymbol) => match([
  [borderWidth: NumberWithUnit, borderStyle: String, borderColor: Color] => ({
    borderWidth, borderWidth.value,
    borderStyle,
    borderColor: bordderColor.to.rgb().to.jsObject(),
  })
])
```

This will give me an object that's easy to consume for my target platform (e.g.: penpot)

```json
{
  "r": 255,
  "g": 0,
  "b": 0
}
```

Or this can could even be straight up converted using a tokenscript schema.

## Conclusion

This makes it so much easier than StyleDictionary with minimal Setup.

Something like this makes something like the penpot implementation soo much easier, as so much of the hassle was dealing with strings and matching them against regexes all over the place!

## Future Ideas

And with a tokenscript schema, this could be done actually by TokensStudio on the platform, no more need for any kind of processor! 

Just drag a couple of transform nodes around and BOOM ðŸ’£ you've got your design data in the shape you need for any platform right out of TokenStudio.

And your input data could be any shape as it's so easy to transform as well.

Imagining even further with ready to consume components as a schema would be amazing!
